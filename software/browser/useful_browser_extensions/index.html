      <h1>Useful browser extensions</h1>
      <p>
      Extensions for browsers I find useful and use on a daily basis.
      </p>

      <h2><a href="https://ublockorigin.com/" target="_blank">uBlock Origin</a></h2>
      <p>
      Most people know uBlock as the best adblock. But it is much more than that.
      Besides ads it also blocks trackers, coin miners, popups, malicious websites and much more,
      all of which you can customize.
      </p>
      <p>A must have extension for web security.</p>

      <h2><a href="https://github.com/OhMyGuus/I-Still-Dont-Care-About-Cookies" target="_blank">I still don't care about cookies</a></h2>
      <p>
      An extension that will hide all cookie warnings from websites, so that you can surf the web without irritations.
      It will try to hide the warning or accept it, when it is needed for proper functioning of the website.
      </p>
      <p>It's also an open-source fork of "I don't care about cookies", which was acquired by Avast.</p>

      <h2><a href="https://darkreader.org/" target="_blank">Dark Reader</a></h2>
      <p>
      Useful extension for people like me who need websites to render in a dark mode, even if they don't support it.
      Dark reader can detect if a website doesn't support a dark mode and than changes it, so that you don't even realize it was changed.
      It can also apply changes, only when you have your browser in dark mode,
      which makes it a perfect extension for users, who change their system theme.
      </p>
      <p>
      Be warned this extension can be resource heavy on some websites, where it doesn't function properly.
      And it also sometimes wrongly detects, that the website is not using a dark mode, even if it does.
      For that reason, I am using it in a manual mode and I am adding the websites, it should work on, myself.
      </p>

      <h2><a href="https://bitwarden.com/" target="_blank">Bitwarden</a></h2>
      <p>
      Bitwarden of course isn't mainly an extension, it is a proper password manager.
      But their browser extension functions very well and I use it a lot, so I am including it here.
      <p>

      <h2><a href="https://www.tampermonkey.net/" target="_blank">Tampermonkey</a></h2>
      <p>
      This plugin allows you to download, create and use small scripts that can allow you to add additional features to websites.
      For example I use a script called <a href="https://github.com/zerodytrash/Simple-YouTube-Age-Restriction-Bypass" target="_blank">Simple YouTube Age Restriction Bypass</a>,
      which as the name says bypasses age restricted videos on YouTube.
      </p>

      <h2><a href="https://sponsor.ajay.app/" target="_blank">SponsorBlock</a></h2>
      <p>
      Do you like watching content on YouTube and do you like not wasting your time?
      Then this extension is for you! It will automatically skip over any parts of the video
      with sponsorship and if you set it up, it can also skip over intros, outros, reviews/recaps and much more.
      </p>
      <p>
      All of this functions only by the help of community,
      which registers segments of the videos, so that the plugin can skip it.
      </p>


      <h2><a href="https://dearrow.ajay.app/" target="_blank">DeArrow</a></h2>
      <p>
      By the same person as SponsorBlock. This extension replaces clickbait titles and thumbnails
      with proper version of them, also submitted by the community.
      </p>
      <p>Together with SponsorBlock a must have extension for browsing YouTube.</p>

      <h2><a href="https://community.kde.org/Plasma/Browser_Integration" target="_blank">Plasma Integration</a></h2>
      <p>
      Very useful for users of the KDE Plama desktop.
      It allows the browser to communicate with it, so that you can better control media,
      send links via KDE Connect, show and control downloads in Plasma's notifications,
      find browser tabs and more.
      </p>

      <h2><a href="https://augmentedsteam.com/" target="_blank">Augmented Steam</a></h2>
      <p>
      Improves the Steam experience by a lot. Adds price info and regional pricing,
      store page customization and useful links, highlights your wishlisted or owned games,
      adds additional filters for better browsing, advanced market features and much more.
      All of which you can customize via it's many options.
      </p>

      <h2><a href="https://www.mrfdev.com/enhancer-for-youtube" target="_blank">Enhancer for YouTubeâ„¢</a></h2>
      <p>
      This extension adds many options to YouTube. You can specify the video speed, it has a better volume control and volume boost.
      But I most use it for automatic resolution selection. You can say in what resolution the videos load
      and what they will use when you maximize it. So you can have a 720p videos in the small window
      and 1440p for full screen.
      </p>

      <h2><a href="https://www.returnyoutubedislike.com/" target="_blank">Return YouTube Dislike</a></h2>
      <p>
      Fuck YouTube for removing the dislike button,
      with this extension you can once again tell if you are watching a scam video.
      </p>
