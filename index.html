          Hi, I’m xefensor. I spend most of my time around games, either playing, analyzing or making them. Besides that I like to try new things, like making this website for example.

        <h2>Philosophy of this website</h2>
        <p>
          This website is meant to be simple. It is using only HTML and CSS. No PHP, JS or any frameworks.
          It is intended for me to be fun to create and edit this website manually, to force me to make it as simple as possible.
          Because I think there is strength in simplicity.
        </p>
        <p>
          That also means there will be no footer, header or nav bar with navigation.
          As it would be a mess to manually edit it on each site.
          Instead each site will have links that will move you further.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is also using the <a href="https://lospec.com/palette-list/resurrect-64" target="_blank">Resurrect 64 Palette</a>
          by Kerrie Lake from LOSPEC. Because I really love it.
          And supports light and dark mode based on your system settings.
