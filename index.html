            Hi, I’m Xefensor. I spend most of my time programming, tinkering with Linux, and building fun experiments.
            Games, personal tools, or just crazy ideas — if it sounds exciting, I’ll probably try it.

        <h2>Philosophy of this website</h2>
        <p>
          This website is meant to be simple. It is using only HTML and CSS. No PHP, JS or any frameworks.
          It is intended for me to be fun to create and edit this website manually, to force me to make it as simple as possible.
          Because I think there is strength in simplicity.
        </p>
        <p>
          That also means there will be no footer, header or nav bar with navigation.
          As it would be a mess to manually edit it on each site.
          Instead each site will have links that will move you further.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is also using the <a href="https://lospec.com/palette-list/resurrect-64">Resurrect 64 Palette</a>
          by Kerrie Lake from LOSPEC. Because I really love it.
          And supports light and dark mode based on your system settings.
