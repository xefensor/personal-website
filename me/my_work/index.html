      <h2>My Games</h2>

        <h3>CyberMania</h3>

          <p>
            CyberMania is a 2d multiplayer arena shooter demo game created for my high school graduation thesis.
            The thesis is absolutely horrible cause I had no idea what the teacher wants from it.
            But I am happy with the game, cause I learned a lot about how multiplayer works, which was what I wanted from it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I did the programming, game design. The sprites and audio are from free online sources.

        <h3>Game of Loop</h3>

          <p>
            Game of Loop is a game jam game, that was created within 3 days for the GMTK 2025 game jam.
            It is a logic game based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a>,
            with the difference that this game limits the grid size and gives the player the challenge
            of spending all available cells, which each behave differently, and making white cells
            survive set amount of generations.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am planning to make this game into a proper full game.
